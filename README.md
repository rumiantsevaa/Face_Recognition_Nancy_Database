##  Nancy is a face recognition program that allows users to search for faces in a database and add new faces. 


#  Why Nancy? If correctly configured one can play Nancy Drew.

## Installation | Requirements

### * Both Flask and flaskwebgui needed to run Nancy as desktop application, yet it can be run in browser manually.
### * To install Face Recognition library you need to install dlib library, there may be issues with its installation. Known tips are both adding wheel of the Python’s corresponding version [ex. dlib-19.24.99-cp312-cp312-win..] and installing C++ environment variables.
### * Front and back end works via flask, which is crucial in setting up pathing and returns.
### * GPU acceleration (via nvidia’s CUDA library) is required for good performance. You’ll also want to enable CUDA support when compliling dlib.


## Thanks to GitHub for cute reward, LOL!
